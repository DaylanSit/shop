To view the deployed applcation, visit: https://daylan-shop.herokuapp.com/



* Developed an e-commerce web app with Model-View-Controller pattern using Node.JS, Express, MySQL, and EJS/HTML 
* Allows shoppers to sign up/login, view all products, add/delete products in their cart, and purchase their items. Allows administrative users to add, delete, and edit their own products on the website
* Implemented security features such as user authentication using sessions and cookies, hashed passwords using BCryptJS, password reset, server-side validation of data, and CSRF protection using CSRF tokens 
* Implemented email sending with SendGrid, file uploads/downloads, pagination of products, and secure payments with Stripe
* Created an Entity Relationship diagram to structure the relational database before it was implemented

**Note: Images are saved and served from Heroku servers. Heroku uses an ephemeral filesystem, so the uploaded image files get wiped when the Heroku servers restart. To fix this, I plan on using a blob store such as Amazon S3**
